# Install beancount-importer's local git hooks. Run once after cloning.
#
# - post-commit: scripts/bump_version.py, which bumps pyproject.toml's
#   [project].version based on the conventional-commit type
#   (feat → minor, fix/refactor/perf → patch, ! / BREAKING → major)
#   and amends the just-created commit to include the bump.
#
# pre-commit / pre-push remain owned by the pre-commit framework
# (`uv run pre-commit install`). This installer only touches post-commit,
# which the framework doesn't manage.
#
# Design rationale: neither prepare-commit-msg nor commit-msg actually
# lets the hook land staged changes in the commit being created.
# git snapshots the index at the start of `git commit` and builds the
# tree from that snapshot — staging from within a hook updates the
# live index but the commit is already pinned. The pre-commit
# framework's stash/restore cycle around its own pre-commit-stage
# hooks compounds the problem. post-commit + `git commit --amend`
# is the only timing where the bump reliably lands in the same
# commit (the SHA changes but the message is preserved).
